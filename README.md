# js-nested-object-filter

Recursive loop for searching matches in a nested JS Object (Hash/Json),
searching for matches in keys and in values.

* In case you are using it to filter a reactive template (like Vue/Angular/...)
then don't forget to bind a _**key**_ attribute for a full rendering of the Object view. 
(binding just a named Key from the Object might not full rerender the template)
