# js-nested-object-search

Recursive loop for searching matches in a nested JS Object (Hash/Json),
searching for matches in keys and in values.

* In case you are using it to filter a reactive template (like Vue/Angular/...)
then don't forget to bind a _**key**_ attribute for a full rendering of the Object view. 
(binding just a named Key from the Object might not full rerender the template)

* I didn't yet covered a case of value as Array...<br>
maybe will get to it soon.<br>
you'll have settled with that for now or add it yourselves...
